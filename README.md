# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Resources
R 4.0.5, RStudio 1.4.1106, MechaCar.csv and SuspensionCoil.csv datasets

## Overview 

A car company has gathered data on multiple prototypes for a new model, the MechaCar.  The first set of data details the vehicle lenght, weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and fuel efficiency in miles per gallon for each prototype, as well as whether each prototype is all wheel drive or not.  The second data set details the weight capacity of the suspension coils accross different production lots for the prototypes.  Using this data, the car company has requested a series of statistical tests.

### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The company has requested a linear regression model to predict the affect of the various attributes recorded in the first data set on fuel efficiency.  Using R, I developed a multiple linear regression model to predict how vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground_clearance, and all wheel drive classification would affect fuel efficiency.  I then gathered the summary statistics of the linear regression model; the model itself and the summary are seen here:
